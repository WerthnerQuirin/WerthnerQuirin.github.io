# Visualisations
Triangles and circles represent individuals which can form relationships which are vizualised using linking lines. In bipartite networks triangles represent women, circels men, while suseptible individuals are shown in blue, infected ones in red and the recovered in green.
Here a simulation over a 100 years is perfomed with 25 timesteps shown

## SI-Model
SI model with added vital dynamics

## SI-Model with vaccinations 
In comparison here individuals entering the system have a 60% propability of beeing vaccinated which in turn decreases the probaility of becoming infected when embarking on a relationship with an infected individual

## SIR-Model with vaccinations
Similar to the model above individuals can enter the system vaccinated but additionally infected people can recover from an infection and can afterwards become suseptible to new infection
