# PRÃ„ZIS

Nearly every case of invasive cervical cancer is caused by a prior Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection. There are over 170 known HPV types of variing cancerogenity. The types are often devided into groups of high- and lowrisk types. Especially the strains 16 and 18 are responsible for 70% of all cervical cancer cases with other highrisk types ammounting to another 60- 90% of the other cases. In Germany this comes down to about 5000 women developing cervical cancer every year which is associated with 1600 deaths. 

Therefore, I am working on a mathematical network model to describe the spreading of cervical cancer throughout the German population to find better ways to tackle this epidemic.
