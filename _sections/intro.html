  Werthner's Original
</header>

My name is Quirin Werthner and I am a pharmacist and Ph.D. student at Saarland University. My interests are
frighteningly divers and range from mathematical modeling of infectious disease dynamics, population pharmacokinetic
analysis (popPK) to literature, politics and whatever peaks my interests.
